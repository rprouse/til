# Stop Server Manager from starting on Login to Windows Server

When you log into Windows Server, Server Manager starts by default. I seldom use it so prefer to disable it.

1. Click `Manage` in the upper right
2. Click `Server Manager Properties`
3. Check `Do not start Server Manager automatically at logon`
