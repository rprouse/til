Learning to hack!

[pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) is an education platform by the University of Arizona for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and wargames. Our philosophy is “practice makes perfect”.
