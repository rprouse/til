## Registers

| 64-bit register | Lowest 32-bits | Lowest 16-bits | 2nd Lowest 8-bits | Lowest 8-bits |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| rax             | eax            | ax             | ah                | al            |

| rsp             | esp            | sp             |                   | spl           |
| r8              | r8d            | r8w            |                   | r8b           |
| r9              | r9d            | r9w            |                   | r9b           |
| r10             | r10d           | r10w           |                   | r10b          |
| r11             | r11d           | r11w           |                   | r11b          |
| r12             | r12d           | r12w           |                   | r12b          |

## Flag Registers

| Name | Symbol | Bit | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carry | CF | 0 | Used to indicate if the previous operation resulted in a carry. |
| Parity | PF | 2 | Used to indicate if the last byte has an even number of 1's (i.e., even parity). |
| Adjust | AF | 4 | Used to support Binary Coded Decimal operations. |
| Zero | ZF | 6 | Used to indicate if the previous operation resulted in a zero result. |
| Sign | SF | 7 | Used to indicate if the result of the previous operation resulted in a 1 in the most significant bit (indicating negative in the context of signed data). |
| Direction | DF | 10 | Used to specify the direction (increment or decrement) for some string operations. |
| Overflow | OF | 11 | Used to indicate if the previous operation resulted in an overflow. |

## Memory Sizes

| Size | Bytes | Bits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quad Word | 8 Bytes | 64 bits |
| Double Word | 4 bytes | 32 bits |
| Word        | 2 bytes | 16 bits |
| Byte        | 1 byte  | 8 bits |

In x86_64, you can access each of these sizes when dereferencing an address, just like using
bigger or smaller register accesses:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mov al, [address]  | moves the least significant byte from address to rax |
| mov ax, [address]  | moves the least significant word from address to rax |
| mov eax, [address] | moves the least significant double word from address to rax |
| mov rax, [address] | moves the full quad word from address to rax |
